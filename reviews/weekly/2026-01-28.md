# Weekly Compounding Review — Week of 2026-01-28

## Shipped
- (none yet)

## Metrics / Signals
- 

## Wins
- We committed to a structured OS (Issues/Projects + templates) to reduce idea-churn.

## Losses / Bugs / Incidents
- 

## Learnings (what we now believe)
- A consistent shaping step is the difference between ideas and shipping.
- Agents need pass/fail tasks; otherwise they drift.

## Process Improvements (make next week easier)
- Add GitHub Issue templates (Idea, Brief, Agent Task Pack).
- Set up a GitHub Project with WIP limit = 1.

## Next Week Bets (1–3)
1. Stand up the GitHub Project board and labels.
2. Run one end-to-end cycle: Inbox → Brief → Task pack → PR.

## Backlog Triage Notes
